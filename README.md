# influxdb_boiler_plate

3 files of shell code to get you started with a Flutter app built on InfluxDB

## Getting Started
1. create your new Flutter project as normal
2. copy main.dart, account_info_form.dary, and account_list_scaffold.dart into your lib directory
3. update the imports to reflect your project name
4. run ```flutter pub add flutter_secure_storage influxdb_client``` to install dependencies
5. Adjust titles and colors, etc... in main.dart as desired
6. To run the MacOS Desktop, you need to add the secure storage dependency. This is most easily done with xcode.
7. Run the project, and add an account.

## To use fl_chart
1. run ```flutter pub add fl_chart```
2. add ```import 'package:fl_chart/fl_chart.dart';``` to your main.dart
